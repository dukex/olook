Feature: stub_with

  The `stub_with` configuration option determines which HTTP stubbing library
  VCR will use.  There are currently 4 supported stubbing libraries which
  support many different HTTP libraries:

    - FakeWeb can be used to stub Net::HTTP.
    - WebMock can be used to stub:
      - Net::HTTP
      - HTTPClient
      - Patron
      - Curb (Curl::Easy, but not Curl::Multi)
      - EM HTTP Request
    - Typhoeus can be used to stub itself (as long as you use Typhoeus::Hydra,
      but not Typhoeus::Easy or Typhoeus::Multi).
    - Excon can be used to stub itself.
    - Faraday can be used (in combination with the provided Faraday middleware)
      to stub requests made through Faraday (regardless of which Faraday HTTP
      adapter is used).

  There are some addiitonal trade offs to consider when deciding which
  stubbing library to use:

    - FakeWeb does not allow you to stub a request based on the headers or body.
      Therefore, the `:match_requests_on` option does not support `:body` or
      `:headers` when you use FakeWeb.  Typhoeus, WebMock and Faraday both
      support matching on `:body` and `:headers`.
    - FakeWeb is currently about 4 times faster than WebMock for stubbing
      Net::HTTP (see benchmarks/http_stubbing_libraries.rb for details).
    - FakeWeb and WebMock both use extensive monkey patching to stub their
      supported HTTP libraries.  No monkey patching is used for Typhoeus or
      Faraday.
    - FakeWeb and WebMock cannot both be used at the same time.
    - Typhoeus, Excon and Faraday can be used together, and with either
      FakeWeb or WebMock.

  Regardless of which library you use, VCR takes care of all of the configuration
  for you.  You should not need to interact directly with FakeWeb, WebMock or the
  stubbing facilities of Typhoeus, Excon or Faraday.  If/when you decide to change stubbing
  libraries (i.e. if you initially use FakeWeb because it's faster but later need the
  additional features of WebMock) you can change the `stub_with` configuration
  option and it'll work with no other changes required.
