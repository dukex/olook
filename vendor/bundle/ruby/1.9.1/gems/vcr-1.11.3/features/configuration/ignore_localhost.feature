Feature: ignore_localhost

  The `ignore_localhost` configuration option can be used to prevent VCR
  from having any affect on localhost requests.  If set to true, it will
  never record them and always allow them, regardless of the record mode,
  and even outside of a `VCR.use_cassette` block.

  This is particularly useful when you use VCR with Capybara, since
  Capybara starts a localhost server and pings it when you use one of
  its javascript drivers.
